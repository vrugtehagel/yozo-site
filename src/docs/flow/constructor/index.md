:::warning
**Warning:** This is a low-level API. It is prone to creating memory leaks if not used with care. For general use, see the [flows](/docs/flow/) page, which covers Yozo's helper functions for common use cases such as event listeners, observers, and timers.
:::

## Syntax

```js
new Flow(callback);
```

### Parameters

`callback`{arg}
: A function to be executed synchronously by the constructor. It receives a single argument; a `trigger`{js} function. This is similar to the `resolve`{js} argument in a callback to a `Promise`{js} constructor, except `trigger`{js} may be called any number of times, each call triggering the flow.

### Return value

A new [`Flow`](/docs/flow/) object. It triggers whenever the `trigger`{js} function given to the `callback`{arg} is called, or when the flow is manually triggered using [`flow.now()`](/docs/flow/now/).

## Examples

### Yozo's interval()

Yozo provides the helper function [`interval()`](/docs/interval/), which is essentially a flowified version of `setInterval()`{js}. Here's how it is implemented.

The first step is to create a flow that triggers with the interval. That part is relatively simple:

```js
function interval(duration){
	return new Flow(trigger => {
		setInterval(trigger, duration);
	});
}
```

However, this by itself has a big lurking issue; the interval never stops. We can call [`flow.stop()`](/docs/flow/stop/) on the flow, but the `setInterval()`{js} will keep going.

:::info
**Note:** When using the development bundle for Yozo, there is a warning to prevent this kind of issue. Specifically, it will throw a warning whenever a flow was stopped, but the `trigger`{js} function given in the constructor is being called.
:::

To fix this issue, we will need to add a proper [`flow.cleanup()`](/docs/flow/cleanup/) handler:

```js
function interval(duration){
	let id;
	return new Flow(trigger => {
		id = setInterval(trigger, duration);
	}).cleanup(() => {
		clearInterval(id);
	});
}
```

Now, we can use the interval function safely, and not only is it cancelable by calling `flow.stop()`{js}, it also automatically participates in monitored contexts. For example, when using it inside a [`connected()`](/docs/components/connected/) hook, it will cancel and clean up the `setInterval()`{js} whenever the component disconnects.

### Deno's watchFs

Originally, the local development server for this site used an async iterator from [Deno](https://deno.com/) to watch the file system for changes. To make it easier to throttle the amount of times the build script runs, and to end the serving after some amount of inactivity, a flow was used to wrap the file watcher. Specifically, we can write a wrapper for the [`Deno.FsWatcher`](https://deno.land/api?s=Deno.FsWatcher) async iterator. Initially, to create the flow, we can simply do

```js
const watcher = Deno.watchFs(['src']);
const flow = new Flow(async trigger => {
	for await (const change of watcher) {
		trigger(change);
	}
});
```

This flow will now trigger whenever the watcher yields another change. However, and this is where manually creating flows gets a little sensitive; calling `.stop()`{js} on the flow does _not_ automatically cancel the watcher. To do so, we'll need to clean up after ourselves:

```js
flow.cleanup(() => {
	watcher.close();
});
```

Now, our flow is safe, and we can easily throttle the changes to acceptable levels. Additionally, we can add a debounce to detect inactivity:

```js
flow.throttle(1000)
	.then(() => build())
	.debounce(3_600_000)
	.once();
```

To stop the watcher manually, we can simply call `flow.stop()`{js}; alternatively, due to the `.debounce()`{js} method combined with `.once()`{js}, the watcher automatically stops after `3_600_000`{js} milliseconds (one hour).

## Usage notes

All flows automatically participate in monitored contexts of [type "undo"](/docs/monitor/undo/). The monitoring is done synchronously inside the constructor, so to prevent monitoring, ignore the constructor itself using [`monitor.ignore()`](/docs/monitor/ignore/):

```js
const flow = monitor.ignore(() => {
	return new Flow(trigger => { /* â€¦ */ });
});
```
