# YOZO'S WEBSITE

Website: [yozo.ooo](https://yozo.ooo/) \
Yozo source: [vrugtehagel/yozo](https://github.com/vrugtehagel/yozo)

## Getting started

You'll need your standard [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) setup with [node](https://nodejs.org/) `v21.7.0` or higher. The site is using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) as static site generator with most documentation pages written in Markdown.

Now, you've got two basic tasks at your disposal:
- `npm run build` builds the site and packages it all up nicely for production.
- `npm run serve` does the whole server + watch thing that you'd want when doing local development.
